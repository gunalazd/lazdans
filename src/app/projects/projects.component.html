        At "The Workshop - Inventors of Play" my main Fronted related tasks
        revolved around UI/UX improvements for sports betting platform. There
        where serveral different sites running from the same Angular/Typescript
        code, tested with Jasmine, Karma and Cypress, deployments where done
        using CI/CD pipelines. Development was done in two week sprint cycles,
        aimed on delivering customers value as soon as posible.

        The vital part of the platform was the betslip - a place where players
        could place their bets. Lots of my work revolved around design
        adjustments and work with components within the betslip. My favorite
        part was adding CSS animations, I felt that it really improved the UX

        For a personal project, I made a
        <a href="https://weather.lazdans.com/" target="_blank">weather app</a>
        in Angular to play around with calls to 3rd party API endpoints to
        retreive information on the weather conditions in selected city, either
        for current weather or temperature forecast for next 5 days (to display
        forecast as a chart I was using Chart.js open-source JavaScript
        library). As source of the weather data I was using openweathermap.org
        API
